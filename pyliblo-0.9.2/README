To install, run "./setup.py build", followed by "./setup.py install". This
will install both the python module and the send_osc/dump_osc scripts.

The C source file generated by Cython is included in the distribution, so
it's not necessary to have Cython installed in order to build pyliblo.
To build from the original Cython source anyway, remove src/liblo.c, then
pass '--with-cython' to setup.py.

See doc/API.html and doc/examples.html for API documentation and some
example code.
